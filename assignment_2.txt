      React - Components, State, Props



Components
---->
     - Components are independent and reusable bits of code. They serve
      the same purpose as JavaScript functions, but work in isolation and
       return HTML.

      -Components come in two types, Class components and Function 
      components, in this tutorial we will concentrate on Function components.


     Class Component
            -A class component must include the extends React.Component statement. 
             This statement creates an inheritance to React.Component, and gives your
              component access to React.Component's functions.


            -The component also requires a render() method, this method returns HTML.

     Function Component
             -A Function component also returns HTML, and behaves much the same way as a
              Class component, but Function components can be written using much less code, 
              are easier to understand, and will be preferred in this tutorial.




State
---->
      -React components has a built-in state object.
       -The state object is where you store property values that belongs to the component.
       -When the state object changes, the component re-renders.
      -The state object is initialized in the constructor:



Props
--->
     -Props are arguments passed into React components.
     -Props are passed to components via HTML attributes.
      -React Props are like function arguments in JavaScript and attributes in HTML.
     -The component receives the argument as a props object
